# itext-doc-creator

A Clojure service (HTTP API) for converting HTML into PDF files.


## Usage

Start a REPL and run `(mount/start)` from the `core` namespace,
or just start the service with `lein run`.

Alternatively built it using `lein uberjar` and then run the `jar`-artifact:

    java -jar target/itext-doc-creator-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

This is good for packaging the application in a container.


### Configuration

The service can be configured with the following environment variables:

| Name              | Description                                        | Required |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `PORT`            | Port for the HTTP service (defaults to `9000`).    | No       |
